~~~~~ A.1. Circumstances Making the Collection of Information Necessary ~~~~~

Tampa Bay was designated an “estuary of national significance” by Congress in 1990, laying the foundation for the creation of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) in 1991. As an independent special district of the state of Florida, TBEP is an intergovernmental partnership of Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco, and Pinellas counties; the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the Southwest Florida Water Management District; and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. TBEP is governed by a Policy Board of elected officials and a Management Board of regional administrators. An interlocal agreement defines the governance structure and funding commitments made by the Management and Policy Board membership. The interlocal agreement is updated every 5-years and describes mutual binding promises to implement actions identified in the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) for Tampa Bay. The mission of the TBEP is to build partnerships to restore and protect the Tampa Bay estuary through implementation of a scientifically sound, community-based management plan, with a vision of TBEP becoming a national leader in applying robust, reproducible science and compelling storytelling to drive community decisions and individual behaviors for the benefit of cleaner waters, thriving habitats and abundant wildlife—all of which sustain our economy and way of life in the Tampa Bay region. The TBEP and its partners have committed to equitably informing and engaging the broader community on issues related to protecting, restoring, and managing the bay.

# Expected Results/Novelty

# Outputs

Results of the study will be submitted for publication as a peer-reviewed journal after completion. All final products and anonymized data will be stored in a public repository on the TBEP GitHub group page (https://github.com/tbep-tech) and made available on additional public archive services (e.g., https://knb.ecoinformatics.org) as needed. In addtion to peer-reviewed articles, TBEP may publish data and/or results from this study in other forms of media, such as technical reports and interactive data visualizations.
