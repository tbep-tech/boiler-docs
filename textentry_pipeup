# Title
Pipe Up Campaign Phase III: Effectiveness of Campaign Messaging on Homeowner Engagement with the Pinellas County Private Sewer Lateral Rebate Program


# Problem Definition

Sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) are generally caused by a lack of treatment capacity, systemic breakdowns (equipment failure, blockages due to fats/oils/grease or non-flushable items), and/or excessive inflow and infiltration to both public and private elements of the wastewater system (illicit connections, leaky pipes). There is a shared responsibility to address the systematic causes of SSOs by both public entities (maintain treatment capacity at WWTPs, maintain equipment and prevent failure, fix leaky manholes/public main distribution lines) and private citizens (proper disposal of fats/oils/grease and non-flushable items, eliminate illicit connections, repair/replace failing privately-owned lateral lines, etc.). Within the Tampa Bay watershed, Pinellas County Utilities is now offering a Private Sewer Lateral (PSL) Rebate program to eligible homeowners in neighborhoods identified as priority areas for PSL inspection and subsequent replacement or rehabilitation, if needed. Prior research has identified financial incentives as a potential solution to key barriers precluding homeowners from inspecting and repairing their PSLs. However, more research is needed to identify the most effective messages for increasing homeowners' participation in the PSL Rebate Program to ensure these financial resources are efficiently utilized and instances of SSOs can be significantly reduced within the watershed.


# Background/Knowledge Gaps

A primary goal of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) is to maintain seagrass at 1950s levels by improving water quality and reducing nitrogen loadings within the Tampa Bay watershed. In 2015-2016, weather events contributed to the discharge of more than 785 million gallons of wastewater within the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Southwest District, including 184 million gallons of wastewater discharged to Tampa Bay and its tributaries by the City of St. Petersburg (https://depnewsroom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/final-with-dwrm-3-st-pete-investigation-report-1-31-17.pdf). These unanticipated sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) represent an additional TN load to Tampa Bay and are contrary to TBEP’s primary goal. Reducing the occurrence of SSOs is a priority action identified in the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for Tampa Bay (WW-5) (https://indd.adobe.com/view/cf7b3c48-d2b2-4713-921c-c2a0d4466632) and would contribute to the continued improvement and maintenance of water quality in Tampa Bay.

TBEP proposes to create a community-based social marketing campaign focused on private citizen behaviors that reduce the future occurrence of SSOs. Preliminary research funded through the TBEP was conducted during 2020-2021 to better understand the barriers and benefits to residential inspection, repair, and replacement of aging PSLs, with a focus on the behavioral determinants that could be leveraged to encourage the desired behaviors. Results from a literature review, in-depth interviews, and an interactive online discussion forum with 19 residents in the watershed uncovered several key insights, including: (1) key knowledge gaps about PSLs for homeowners; (2) the important of visuals for increasing the saliency of PSLs; (3) the importance of rebates or financial incentives for encouraging voluntary PSL inspection/repair; (4) key triggering events for action, such as bying a new home or experiencing a sewer backup; (5) key trusted intermediaries of information, such as home inspectors and plumbers. A brief campaign titled "Pipe Up!" was launched in 2021 targetting homebuyers, home inspectors, and plumbers, which produced a mostly positive sentiment in audiences, increased awareness of PSLs, and increased website engagement in the target audiences.

However, the previous research efforts were conducted prior to the launch of the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program, and discussions of potential financial incentives were thus only theoretical in nature. With this Rebate Program comes an opportunity to test the effectiveness of these financial incentives in generating real behavior change in target audiences and launch a new evidence-based social marketing campaign to increase homeowners' inspection and repair of the PSLs. This study will thus expand upon the existing knowledge of key drivers and barriers to voluntary PSL inspections/repairs to determine the most effective Pipe Up campaign messaging strategy for implementation in Pinellas County.


# Project Overview

The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) will conduct a study investigating homeowners' participation in the Pinellas County Private Sewer Lateral Rebate Program. Informed by preliminary research conducted on Tampa Bay homeowners in 2020-2021, this study will generate new insights into PSL campaign messaging strategies and the effectiveness of different messages on homeowner engagement with the PSL Rebate Program. The project will consist of three primary tasks: (1) focus group message testing; (2) Pipe Up campaign experimental testing; (3) Pipe Up campaign launch and monitoring. 


# Project Timeline - Relative

The study is anticipated to run for two years. Focus groups will be conducted following QAPP and ICR approval, estimated in July to August 2024. Based on the results of the focus groups, three different Pipe Up mail advertisements will be designed representating a control message and two treatment messages over the course of August to September 2024. The advertisements will be mailed and data will be collected on engagement rates during October to November 2024, with subsequent analyses of the results anticipated to be completed by January 2025. Based upon the results of the experimental test, a new social marketing campaign for Pipe Up will be designed and launched in Spring 2025, including both digital and mail campaigns. Data from the campaign engagement metrics will be analyzed and the results will be reported in a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal by Fall 2025.  


# Project Need

A primary goal of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) is to maintain seagrass at 1950s levels by improving water quality and reducing nitrogen loadings within the Tampa Bay watershed. In 2015-2016, weather events contributed to the discharge of more than 785 million gallons of wastewater within the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Southwest District, including 184 million gallons of wastewater discharged to Tampa Bay and its tributaries by the City of St. Petersburg (https://depnewsroom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/final-with-dwrm-3-st-pete-investigation-report-1-31-17.pdf). These unanticipated sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) represent an additional TN load to Tampa Bay and are contrary to TBEP’s primary goal. Reducing the occurrence of SSOs is a priority action identified in the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for Tampa Bay (WW-5) (https://indd.adobe.com/view/cf7b3c48-d2b2-4713-921c-c2a0d4466632) and would contribute to the continued improvement and maintenance of water quality in Tampa Bay. This study will contribute to our knowledge of homeowner perceptions of SSOs and PSLs, as well as their interests and motivations to voluntary inspect and repair their PSLs, which will be a key pathway to signficantly reducing the occurrence of SSOs in the Tampa Bay watershed.


# Consequences of Not Collecting Information

Evidence-based behavioral research is necessary for designing and implementing marketing campaigns that can effectively increase the number of homeowners voluntarily scheduling an inspection and subsequent repair (if needed) of their PSL. Current data suggests that participation in the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program remains low, leaving an crucial financial resource largely untapped. Innovative solutions to promoting the Rebate Program, raising PSL and SSO awareness in the community, and triggering behavior change on the ground are required to significantly reduce the occurence of SSOs in the watershed and their subsequent effects on the health and resilience of Tampa Bay. 


# Experimental Design



# Technology

Focus groups will be held in-person. Audio of conversations and participant responses will be recorded using Audacity Software and transcribed using Deepgram AI (with verification performed by Dr. Simmons). Analyses of campaign messaging effects will be based upon metrics tracked by Google Analytics on the Eligibility Screener website.


# Sampling Methods



# Task 1

Task 1 will consist of three focus groups. Each focus group will consist of 6-8 residents (N = 18-24), which each focus group targeted toward residents within a specific neighborhood that qualifies for the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program: Lealman, Seminole, and East Lake. To be included in the focus group, residents must meet the following criteria: (1) they own a home in the respective neighborhood, (2) they are between the ages of 25 to 60, and (3) they have not previously inspected or repaired their home's PSL. Efforts will be made to maximize the diversity of participants according to age, gender, and race. Translation services will also be available by request to residents whose primary language is Spanish or Vietnamese. Participants will be recruited through advertisements on social media, at key meeting places (e.g., community/family centers), and other points of contact (e.g. homeowner or neighborhood associations, local community leaders). The focus groups will take place in a public meeting location within the respective neighborhood, such as a public library, community center, or other meeting space to reduce travel burdens on participants. Each participant will be offered $60 in compensation for their time and any other travel-, work-, or care-related burdens that participation in the focus group may incur. Each focus group is anticipated to last between 60 to 90 minutes and will be held in the early evening on weekdays and/or in the early afternoon on weekends to account for work or school responsibilities. Prospective participants will be able to list their preferred time in their response to the advertisement.

The focus groups will be facilitated by Dr. Simmons. During the focus groups, Dr. Simmons will gauge the current extent (and gaps) in participants' knowledge of PSLs and the Rebate Program. After providing participants with a description of PSLs and the Rebate Program, Dr. Simmons will introduce participants to the goal of the Pipe Up campaign. Each participant will be presented with four different images that could be used in future campaign materials, with each image designed to tackle a particular barrier or driver for PSL inspection/repair - knowledge of PSLs, salience of PSLs, trusted intermediaries, and loss aversion. Participants will be asked to share their thoughts on each image. Next, Dr. Simmons will present six different messages to each participant that could be incorporated into future campaign materials. Again, each message will be designed ariybd a particular behavioral barrier/driver - knowledge about the Rebate Program, knowledge about PSL issues, loss aversion, social norms, sense of control, and sense of pride - and participants will be asked to share their opinions on each message and their preferences. Finally, Dr. Simmons will do a walk-through of a prototype of the PSL Rebate Program Eligibility Screener - a website designed to assist homeowners in determining if they may be eligible for the PSL Rebate Program. Participants will then be asked to share their thoughts on the design and usefulness of the website. 

The PSL Rebate Program Eligibility Screener website will be created as an R Shiny App and will contain an overview of the Rebate Program, as well as a form that the user can complete to assess their potential eligibilty for the Rebate Program. This form contains the following question and response options: (1) What is your ZIP code? [open]; (2) Do you own a single-family home? [Yes/No]; (3) Is your home serviced by Pinellas County Utilities? [Yes/No/I'm not sure]; (4) Does your home's private sewer lateral connect directly to the Pinellas County sanitary sewer system? [Yes/No/I'm not sure]; (5) Do you currently owe money to Pinellas County through any liens or unpaid fees? [Yes/No/I'm not sure]. After completing the form and clicking "Check your eligibility", they will be informed if they are likely or unlikely to be eligible for the Rebate Program based on their responses. For those who are likely eligible, additional information will be provided on how to fulfill the requirements for the rebate. For those who are likely ineligible, additional information on the eligibility criteria will be provided. All users will be encouraged to contact Pinellas County officials to confirm their eligibility regardless of the outcome of the screening tool. The prototype website is available from https://shiny.tbep.org/psl-rebate/, with screenshots in Appendix X.

Discussion prompts will be used to facilitate conversations around nine central topics: (1) the characteristics of their home; (2) their current knowledge of PSLs; (3) their current knowledge of PSL issues; (4) their prior experience with any PSL issues; (5) their familiarity with the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program; (6) their thoughts on the Rebate Program; (7) their thoughts on a series of potential PSL campaign images; (8) their thoughts on a series of potential PSL campaign messages; (9) their thoughts on the PSL Rebate Program Eligibility Screener website. A complete list of the prompts and potential probes for the focus group discussions is available in Appendix X.

Conversations from the focus groups will be recorded and transcribed and subsequently used for qualitative analysis by Dr. Simmons. The responses will be used to inform the design of Pipe Up campaign mail advertisements and an updated Eligibility Screener website for use in Task 2.

Deliverable(s):
 - Focus group transcripts (anonymized)
 - Technical Report
 

# Task 2

Task 2 will consist of an experimental research design to identify the most effective Pipe Up campaign message for increasing homeowner engagement with the Eligibility Screener website. Postcard advertisements will be mailed to single-family homes within the neighborhoods eligible for the PSL Rebate Program. The postcards will contain different images and messages centered around the Rebate Program, with the same request for action: to visit the Eligibility Screener website to find out if their home is eligible for a rebate. Three types of postcard mail advertisements will be designed. The first postcard will serve as an experimental control; the postcard will feature images and messaging characteristic of the existing PSL Rebate Program website and aligned with materials typically published by Pinellas County. The second postcard will serve as an experimental treatment (Treatment A), in which the Rebate Program will be advertised using images and messages previously used in the preliminary Pipe Up campaign (2021). The third postcard will serve as an additional treatment (Treatment B) and will be designed to advertise the Rebate Program using new images and messages hypothesized to maximize the likelihood of homeowners visiting the Eligibility Screener website based upon focus group feedback (Task 1).

Approximately 55,000 single-family homes are within the eligible neighborhood zones of the PSL Rebate Program. Using stratified random sampling, each postcard will be mailed to 2,001 homes, with an equal number of each postcard (n = 667) mailed to homes in the three primary neighborhoods (Lealman, Seminole, and East Lake). This approach ensures that the effects of confounding factors on any observed differences in homeowner engagement between and within neighborhoods will be minimized, such as geospatial, socioeconomic, or cultural differences between neighborhoods. In total, this represents 6,003 homes (11%) within the program eligibility area. Assuming a low engagement rate of 5-10%, this equates to an estimated total sample size of 300-600 homeowners for subsequent analyses, providing sufficient statistical power for comparisons between the three response groups (Control, Treatment A, and Treatment B) while minimizing the population exposed to potentially ineffective campaign messages.

Data on the behavior of interest - visiting the Eligibility Screener website - will be collected using standard Google Analytics (GA4) metrics. Three identical Eligibility Screener websites will be created as R Shiny Apps with different URLs corresponding to the Control, Treatment A, or Treatment B postcard. Across the three websites, the following data will be compared: (1) number of new users (primary response variable of interest), (2) number of eligibility screener clicks (secondary response variable of interest), (3) number of returning users, (4) number of clicks to the official PSL Rebate Program website, (5) number of eligibility screener submissions that are (and are not) likely eligible for the Rebate Program, (6) diversity of ZIP codes submitted in the eligibility screener form. Additional demographic data will be collected for each user via Google Signals within the GA4 platform (for users that are logged into an existing Google account with Ad Personalization enabled) as supplemental data.

Results will be analyzed to compare the response variables between the control and treatment sites and test the hypothesis that Treatment B postcards will result in significantly more new users and eligibility screener click rates than the Control and Treatment A postcards. The results will be reported in a manuscript and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.  

Deliverable(s):
 - 3 Pipe Up campaign postcard designs
 - 3 Eligibility Screener websites
 - Database of website engagement metrics
 - Manuscript for peer review


# Task 3

The final task of this project will be the launch of a new Pipe Up social marketing campaign aimed at homeowners eligible for the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program. The campaign will be informed by the results of Task 2 using content from the postcard determined to have the greatest effect on homeowner engagement. Mail advertisements will be distributed to an additional 10,000 homes within the area of eligible neighborhoods, and digital ads will be created and distributed on social media platforms using Google Ads (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). An official Pipe Up page will be hosted on the TBEP website, which will include an updated version of the Eligibility Screener tool. Engagement with the campaign will continue to be monitored via GA4, and the same engagement data collected in Task 2 will be collected during the official campaign to determine if engagement rates are reaching expected levels. After review and evaluation of the campaign relative to the results in Task 2, results will be reported in a manuscript and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. If engagement rates are as expected (or better), the campaign will continue in subsequent years. Should engagement rates perform below expectations, additional investigation will be warranted for future research.

Deliverable(s):
 - Pipe Up webpage with Eligibility Screener
 - Print ad for Pipe Up campaign
 - Digital (photo) ad for Pipe Up campaign
 - Digital (video) ad for Pipe Up campaign
 - Database of website engagement metrics
 - Manuscript for peer review

# Expected Results/Novelty

The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) will conduct a study investigating


# Expected Analyses

Dr. Simmons will be responsible for all data analysis. Analyses are expected to include


# Outputs

Results from Task 1 will be summarized in an open-access TBEP Technical Report. Results from Tasks 2 and 3 will be submitted for publication as peer-reviewed journal articles after completion. All final products and anonymized data will be stored in a public repository on the TBEP GitHub group page (https://github.com/tbep-tech) and made available on additional public archive services (e.g., https://knb.ecoinformatics.org) as needed. In addtion to peer-reviewed articles, TBEP may publish data and/or results from this study in other forms of media, such as technical reports and interactive data visualizations.

These results and any associated publications will be presented or distributed to interested TBEP partners, such as the City of St. Petersburg, City of Tampa, Hillsborough County, Pinellas County, and Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council. In addition to informing regional partners about the effectiveness of different messages on homeowner engagement rates, the results of this study will inform the development of a new Pipe Up social marketing campaign delivered by the TBEP to promote participation in the Pinellas County PSL Rebate Program.
